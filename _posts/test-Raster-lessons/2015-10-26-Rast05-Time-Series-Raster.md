##About
This lesson covers how to work with and plot a raster time series, using an `R`
`RasterStack` object. It also covers practical assessment of data quality
in remote sensing derived imagery.

**R Skill Level:** Intermediate - you've got the basics of `R` down.

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">

###Goals / Objectives

After completing this activity, you will:

* Understand the format of a time series raster dataset.
* Know how to work with time series rasters. 
* Be able to efficiently import a set of rasters stored in a single directory.
* Be able to plot and explore time series raster data using the `plot()`
function in `R`.

**To complete this lesson:** you will need the most current version of R, and 
preferably RStudio, loaded on your computer.

####R Libraries to Install:

* **raster:** `install.packages("raster")`
* **rgdal:** `install.packages("rgdal")`

####Data to Download

<a href=" https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/3579867" class="btn btn-success"> Download Landsat derived NDVI raster files</a> 

The imagery data used to create this raster teaching data subset were collected
over the National Ecological Observatory Network's
<a href="http://www.neoninc.org/science-design/field-sites/harvard-forest" target="_blank" >Harvard Forest</a>
and 
<a href="http://www.neoninc.org/science-design/field-sites/san-joaquin-experimental-range" target="_blank" >San Joaquin Experimental Range</a>
field sites.  
The imagery was created by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) using a 
<a href="http://eros.usgs.gov/#/Find_Data/Products_and_Data_Available/MSS" target="_blank" >  multispectral scanner</a>
on a <a href="http://landsat.usgs.gov" target="_blank" > Landsat Satellite </a>.
The data files are Geographic Tagged Image-File Format (GeoTIFF). 

**Set Working Directory:** This lessons assumes that you have set your working 
directory to the location of the downloaded and unzipped data subset. [An overview
of setting the working directory in `R` can be found here.]({{site.baseurl}}/R/Set-Working-Directory "R Working Directory Lesson")

#About Raster Time Series Data

A raster data file can contain one single band or many bands. If the raster data 
contains imagery data, each band may represent reflectance for a different 
wavelength (color or type of light) or set of wavelengths - for
example red, green and blue. A multi-band raster may two or more bands or layers
of data collected at different times for the same `extent` (region) and of the 
same `resolution`.

The raster data that we will use in this lesson are located in the (`Landsat_NDVI\HARV\ndvi`)
directory and cover part of the 
<a href="http://www.neoninc.org/science-design/field-sites/harvard-forest" target="_blank">NEON Harvard Forest field site</a>.

In this lesson, we will:

1. Import NDVI data in `GeoTIFF` format.
2. Import, explore and plot NDVI data derived for several dates throughout the year. 
3. View the RGB imagery used to derived the NDVI time series to better understand 
unusual / outlier values. 

##NDVI data
The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index or NDVI is a quantitative index of 
greenness ranging from 0-1 where 0 represents minimal or no greenness and 1 
represents maximum greenness. 

NDVI is often used for a quantative proxy measure of vegetation health, cover and
phenology (life cycle stage) over large areas. Our NDVI data is a Landsat derived 
single band product saved as a GeoTIFF for different times of the year. 

<figure>

    <figcaption>NDVI is calculated from the visible and near-infrared light
    reflected by vegetation. Healthy vegetation (left) absorbs most of the
    visible light that hits it, and reflects a large portion of
    near-infrared light. Unhealthy or sparse vegetation (right) reflects more
    visible light and less near-infrared light. Image & Caption Source: NASA

##RGB data
While the NDVI data is a single band product, the RGB images that contain the red 
band used to derive NDVI, contain 3 (of the 7) 30m resolution bands available 
from Landsat data. The RGB directory contains RGB images for each time period 
that NDVI is available.

##Getting Started 
In this lesson, we will use the `raster` and `rgdal` libraries.


    #load libraries
    library(raster)
    library(rgdal)

To begin, we will create a list of raster files using the `list.files()` function
in `R`. This list will be used to generate a `RasterStack`. We will only add files
to our list with a `.tif` extension using the syntax `pattern=".tif$"`.

If we specify `full.names=TRUE`, the full path for each file will be added to
the list. 


    # Create list of NDVI file paths
    # assign path to object = cleaner code
    NDVI_HARV_path <- "Landsat_NDVI/HARV/2011/ndvi" 
    all_NDVI_HARV <- list.files(NDVI_HARV_path,
                                full.names = TRUE,
                                pattern = ".tif$")
    
    #view list - note the full path, relative to our working directory, is included
    all_NDVI_HARV

    ##  [1] "Landsat_NDVI/HARV/2011/ndvi/005_HARV_ndvi_crop.tif"
    ##  [2] "Landsat_NDVI/HARV/2011/ndvi/037_HARV_ndvi_crop.tif"
    ##  [3] "Landsat_NDVI/HARV/2011/ndvi/085_HARV_ndvi_crop.tif"
    ##  [4] "Landsat_NDVI/HARV/2011/ndvi/133_HARV_ndvi_crop.tif"
    ##  [5] "Landsat_NDVI/HARV/2011/ndvi/181_HARV_ndvi_crop.tif"
    ##  [6] "Landsat_NDVI/HARV/2011/ndvi/197_HARV_ndvi_crop.tif"
    ##  [7] "Landsat_NDVI/HARV/2011/ndvi/213_HARV_ndvi_crop.tif"
    ##  [8] "Landsat_NDVI/HARV/2011/ndvi/229_HARV_ndvi_crop.tif"
    ##  [9] "Landsat_NDVI/HARV/2011/ndvi/245_HARV_ndvi_crop.tif"
    ## [10] "Landsat_NDVI/HARV/2011/ndvi/261_HARV_ndvi_crop.tif"
    ## [11] "Landsat_NDVI/HARV/2011/ndvi/277_HARV_ndvi_crop.tif"
    ## [12] "Landsat_NDVI/HARV/2011/ndvi/293_HARV_ndvi_crop.tif"
    ## [13] "Landsat_NDVI/HARV/2011/ndvi/309_HARV_ndvi_crop.tif"

Now we have a list of all GeoTIFF files in the `ndvi` directory for Harvard
Forest. Next, we will create a `RasterStack` from this list using the `stack()` 
function. 


    # Create a raster stack of the NDVI time series
    NDVI_HARV_stack <- stack(all_NDVI_HARV)

We can explore the GeoTIFF tags (the embedded metadata) in a `stack` using the same
syntax that we used on single-band raster objects in `R` including: `CRS` (coordinate
reference system), `extent` and `res` (resolution).


    #view crs of rasters
    crs(NDVI_HARV_stack)

    ## CRS arguments:
    ##  +proj=utm +zone=19 +ellps=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs

    #view extent of rasters in stack
    extent(NDVI_HARV_stack)

    ## class       : Extent 
    ## xmin        : 239415 
    ## xmax        : 239535 
    ## ymin        : 4714215 
    ## ymax        : 4714365

    #view the y resolution of our rasters
    yres(NDVI_HARV_stack)

    ## [1] 30

    #view the x resolution of our rasters
    xres(NDVI_HARV_stack)

    ## [1] 30

<div id="challenge" markdown="1">
##Challenge: Raster Metadata

Answer the following questions about our `RasterStack`.

1. What is the `CRS`?
2. What is the x and y `resolution` of the data? 
3. What `units` is the above resolution in?

</div>



#Plotting Time Series Data
Once we have created our `RasterStack`, we can visualize our data. We can use
the `plot()` command to quickly plot a `RasterStack`.


    #view a plot of all of the rasters
    #'nc' specifies number of columns (we will have 13 plots)
    plot(NDVI_HARV_stack, 
         zlim = c(1500, 10000), 
         nc = 4)

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rfigs/05-Time-Series-Raster/plot-time-series-1.png) 

Have a look at the range of NDVI values observed in the plot above. We know that
the accepted values for NDVI range from 0-1. Why does our data range from
0 - 10,000? 

##Scale Factors
The metadata for this NDVI data specifies a scale factor: 10,000. A scale factor
is sometimes used to maintain smaller file sizes by removing decimal places. 
Storing data in integer format keeps files sizes smaller.

Let's apply the scale factor before we go any further. Conveniently, we can 
quickly apply this factor using raster math on the entire stack as follows:

`raster_stack_object_name / 10000`

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** We can make this plot  
even prettier by fixing the individual tile names, adding an plot title and by
using the (`levelplot`) function. This is covered in the NEON Data Skills 
[Plot Time Series Rasters in R ]({{ site.baseurl }}/R/Plot-Raster-Times-Series-Data-In-R/) 
lesson. 
{: .notice }


    #apply scale factor to data
    NDVI_HARV_stack <- NDVI_HARV_stack/10000
    #plot stack with scale factor applied
    #apply scale factor to limits to ensure uniform plottin
    plot(NDVI_HARV_stack,
         zlim = c(.15, 1),  
         nc = 4)

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rfigs/05-Time-Series-Raster/apply-scale-factor-1.png) 


##Take a Closer Look at Our Data
Let's take a closer look at the plots of our data. Note that Massachusettes, 
where the NEON Harvard Forest Field Site is located has a fairly consistent fall, 
winter, spring and summer season where vegetation turns green in the spring, continues
to grow throughout the summer, and begins to change colors and senesce in the fall
through winter. Do you notice anything that seems unusual about the patterns of
greening and browning observed in the plots above?

Hint: the number after the "X"" in each tile title is the Julian day which in this
case represents the number of days into each year. If you are unfamiliar with 
Julian day, check out the NEON Data Skills 
[Converting to Julian Day ]({{ site.baseurl }}/R/julian-day-conversion/) 
lesson.

##View Distribution of Raster Values
In the above exercise, we viewed plots of our NDVI time series and noticed a 
few images seem to be unusually light. However this was only a visual representation
of potential issues in our data. What is another way we can look at these data 
that is quantitative? 

Next we will use histograms to explore the distribution of NDVI values stored in
each raster.


    #create histograms of each raster
    hist(NDVI_HARV_stack, 
         xlim = c(0, 1))

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rfigs/05-Time-Series-Raster/view-stack-histogram-1.png) 

It seems like things get green in the spring and summer like we expect, but the 
data at Julian days 277 and 293 are unusual. It appears as if the vegetation got
green in the spring, but then died back only to get green again towards the end 
of the year. Is this right?

###Explore Unusual Data Patterns
The NDVI data that we are using comes from 2011, perhaps a strong freeze around
Julian day 277 could cause a vegetation to senesce early, however in the Eastern
United States, it seems unusual that it would proceed to green up again shortly 
thereafter. 

Let's next view some temperature data for our field site to see whether there 
were some unusual fluctuations that may explain this pattern of greening and browning
seen in the NDVI data.


    ## Warning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 3.2.3

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rfigs/05-Time-Series-Raster/view-temp-data-1.png) 

There are no significant peaks or dips in the temperature during the late summer
or early fall time period that might account for patterns seen in the NDVI data.

What is our next step? 

Let's have a look at the source Landsat imagery that was partially used used to 
derive our NDVI rasters to try to understand what appears to be outlier NDVI values.

<div id="challenge" markdown="1">
##Challenge: Examine RGB Raster Files

1. Load the imagery located in the `RGB` directory. 
2. Plot the RGB images & identify the plots for the Julian days 277 and 293.
3. Does the RGB imagery from these two days explain the low NDVI values observed
on these days?  
</div>

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rfigs/05-Time-Series-Raster/view-all-rgb-1.png) 

##Explore Your Data's Source
The third challenge question, "Does the RGB imagery from these two days explain 
the low NDVI values observed on these days?" highlights the importance of
exploring the source of a derived data product. In this case, the NDVI data product
was derived from (created using) Landsat imagery - specifically the red and near-infrared
bands.

When we look at the RGB collected at Julian days 277 and 293 we see that most of the  
image is filled with clouds. The very low NDVI values resulted from cloud cover -
a common challenge that we encounter when working with satellite remote sensing 
imagery.
