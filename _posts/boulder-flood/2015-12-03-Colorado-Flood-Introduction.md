    <figcaption>This is an animated loop of water vapor systems over the western 
    area of North America on September 12th, 2013 as shown by the GOES-15 and 
    GOES-13 satellites. The storm that caused the 2013 Colorado flooding was kept 
    in a confined area over the Eastern Range of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado 
    by these water vapor systems. SOURCES: Cooperative Institute for Meteorological
