#Introduction to Disturbance Events

Within ecology, disturbance events are those events which cause dramatic change
in an ecosystem through a temporary, often rapid, change in environmental
conditions. Although the disturbance events themselves can be of short duration,
the ecological effects last decades, if not longer. 

Common examples of natural ecological disturbances include hurricanes, fires, 
floods, earthquakes and windstorms.

Disturbance events can also be human caused: clear cuts when logging, fires to clear forests for cattle grazing or the building of new housing developments are all common disturbances.

Ecological communities are often more resilient to some types of disturbance than
others. Some communities are even dependent on cyclical disturbance events. 
Lodgepole pine (_Pinus_ _contorta_) forests in the Western US are dependent on
frequent stand-replacing fires to release seeds and spur the growth of young 
trees.

However, in discussions of ecological disturbance events we think about events 
that disrupt the status of the ecosystem and change the structure of the
landscape.
