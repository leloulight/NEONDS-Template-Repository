# How do We Measure Changes in Terrain? LiDAR!

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EYbhNSUnIdU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

1. How can LiDAR data be collected?  
2. How might we use LiDAR to hlep study the 2013 Colorado Floods?

### Using LiDAR Data

LiDAR data can be used to create many different models of a landscape.  This
brief lesson on 
<a href="http://neondataskills.org/remote-sensing/2_LiDAR-Data-Concepts_Activity2/" target="_blank">
"What is a CHM, DSM and DTM? About Gridded, Raster LiDAR Data"</a> explores
three important landscape models that are commonly used.  

1. How might we use a CHM, DSM or DTM model to better understand what happened
in the 2013 Colorado Flood? 
2. Would you use only one of the models or could you use two or more of them
together?

###More Details on LiDAR

If you are particularly interested in how LiDAR works consider taking a closer
look at how the data is collected and represented by going through this tutorial
on <a href="http://neondataskills.org/remote-sensing/1_About-LiDAR-Data-Light-Detection-and-Ranging_Activity1/" target="_blank"> "Light Detection and Ranging."</a>

models are three common lidar derived data products. The digital terrain model
allows scientists to study changes in terrain (topography) over time.
